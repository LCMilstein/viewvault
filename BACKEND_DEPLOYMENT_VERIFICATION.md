# Backend Deployment Verification Request

## Issue
The mobile Auth0 implementation from `MOBILE_AUTH0_IMPLEMENTATION.md` has not been deployed yet. The iOS app is getting 404 errors because the new endpoint doesn't exist.

## Evidence That Changes Are Not Deployed

### 1. Missing Mobile Endpoint
```bash
curl -s https://app.viewvault.app/openapi.json | jq '.paths | keys | .[] | select(contains("mobile"))'
# Returns: (empty - no mobile endpoints found)
```

The `/api/auth/auth0/mobile-callback` endpoint returns 404 Not Found.

### 2. Audience URL Still Broken
```bash
curl -s https://app.viewvault.app/api/auth/auth0/config
# Returns: {"audience":"https//api.viewvault.app"}  # Missing colon!
```

Should return: `{"audience":"https://api.viewvault.app"}`

### 3. Original Endpoint Still Failing
```bash
curl -X POST https://app.viewvault.app/api/auth/auth0/callback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"access_token":"test"}'
# Returns: 500 {"detail":"Auth0 callback failed: "}
```

## Required Actions

### ✅ Deploy the Mobile Auth0 Implementation
Please deploy the changes from `MOBILE_AUTH0_IMPLEMENTATION.md`:

1. **Create the mobile endpoint**: `/api/auth/auth0/mobile-callback`
2. **Fix the audience URL**: Change `https//api.viewvault.app` to `https://api.viewvault.app`
3. **Support both client IDs**: Web (`6O0NKgLmUN6fo0psLnu6jNUYQERk5fRw`) and Mobile (`LwycPWxp6CJCRZe7OeA2EvXgrpTTFBwx`)

### ✅ Verification Tests After Deployment

After deployment, these should work:

```bash
# 1. Mobile endpoint should exist
curl -s https://app.viewvault.app/openapi.json | grep "mobile-callback"
# Should return: "/api/auth/auth0/mobile-callback"

# 2. Audience URL should be fixed
curl -s https://app.viewvault.app/api/auth/auth0/config
# Should return: {"audience":"https://api.viewvault.app"}  # With colon

# 3. Mobile endpoint should accept requests (even with invalid token)
curl -X POST https://app.viewvault.app/api/auth/auth0/mobile-callback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"access_token":"test"}'
# Should return: 400 or 401 (not 404 or 500)
```

## Current Status
- ❌ Mobile endpoint: 404 Not Found
- ❌ Audience URL: Missing colon
- ❌ Token validation: Still failing
- ✅ iOS app: Ready and waiting for backend deployment

## Impact
The iOS app cannot authenticate until these backend changes are deployed. The mobile app is correctly configured and ready to work once the backend is updated.

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Mobile authentication is completely blocked until deployment.
