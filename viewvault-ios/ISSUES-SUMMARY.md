# Current Issues and Solutions

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. Import/Search Functionality Not Working
**Problem**: The iOS app is trying to use search and import endpoints that don't exist on the backend.

**Root Cause**: The backend at `https://wlapp.umpyours.com/api` only has these endpoints:
- `GET /` - API info
- `GET /watchlist` - Requires authentication
- Other endpoints return 404

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging to see what endpoints are being called
- ✅ Added fallback error handling for missing endpoints
- ✅ Improved user experience with clear error messages
- ❌ Backend search/import endpoints need to be implemented

### 2. Runtime Sort Button Not Working
**Problem**: Runtime sort button appears to sort alphabetically instead of by runtime.

**Root Cause**: The backend may not be properly handling the `runtime` sort parameter, or the data doesn't contain runtime information.

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Added debugging to see what sort parameters are sent
- ✅ Added debugging to see what data is returned
- ✅ Backend-driven sorting is implemented correctly
- ❌ Need to verify backend handles `runtime` sort parameter

## 🛠 Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added multiple endpoint format attempts for search/import
- Clear user feedback when functionality is not available
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Improved Debugging
- Added console logging for API requests
- Added debugging for sort parameters and responses
- Added runtime data verification

### 3. Better User Experience
- Clear error messages when search/import is not available
- Loading indicators during search operations
- Graceful fallbacks for missing functionality

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Search/Import Functionality:
1. **Backend Implementation Required**: The search and import endpoints need to be implemented on the backend:
   - `GET /api/search/movie?q={query}`
   - `GET /api/search/series?q={query}`
   - `POST /api/import/movie` with `{tmdb_id: string}`
   - `POST /api/import/series` with `{tmdb_id: string}`

2. **TMDB Integration**: The backend needs to integrate with TMDB API for search and import functionality.

### For Runtime Sorting:
1. **Backend Verification**: Check if the backend properly handles the `runtime` sort parameter
2. **Data Verification**: Ensure movie data includes runtime information
3. **Testing**: Test with authenticated requests to see actual sort behavior

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Search/Import Testing:
- [ ] Test search with "avengers" in Import mode
- [ ] Verify error message appears when endpoints don't exist
- [ ] Test import selection when search works
- [ ] Verify import adds items to watchlist

### Runtime Sort Testing:
- [ ] Click runtime sort button
- [ ] Check console logs for sort parameters
- [ ] Verify data returned includes runtime information
- [ ] Test ascending/descending runtime sort
- [ ] Verify UI updates with sorted data

## 🔧 Backend Requirements

The backend needs to implement these endpoints:

```python
# Search endpoints
@app.get("/api/search/movie")
@app.get("/api/search/series")

# Import endpoints  
@app.post("/api/import/movie")
@app.post("/api/import/series")
```

These should integrate with TMDB API for external search and import functionality.

## 📱 Current App Status

- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Watchlist display working
- ✅ Toggle watched status working
- ✅ Sort/filter UI working
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ❌ Search/import needs backend implementation
- ❌ Runtime sort needs backend verification
