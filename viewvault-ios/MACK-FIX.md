# 🛠️ Mack's iOS Setup Fix

Hey Mack! I've created the iOS project files you need. Here's how to fix the nested directory issue:

## 🚀 Quick Fix

### 1. Use the Fixed Setup Script
```bash
cd ViewVaultApp
chmod +x setup-ios-fix.sh
./setup-ios-fix.sh
```

### 2. Or Manual Setup (if the script doesn't work)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## 📁 iOS Project Files Created

I've created all the iOS files you need:

- ✅ `ios/Podfile` - CocoaPods configuration
- ✅ `ios/ViewVaultApp/Info.plist` - App configuration with network security
- ✅ `ios/ViewVaultApp/AppDelegate.h` & `AppDelegate.mm` - App lifecycle
- ✅ `ios/ViewVaultApp/ViewController.h` & `ViewController.mm` - Main view
- ✅ `ios/ViewVaultApp/LaunchScreen.storyboard` - Launch screen
- ✅ `ios/ViewVaultApp/main.m` - App entry point

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The original setup script was running:
```bash
npx react-native init ViewVaultApp
```

This creates a NEW project structure, but you already had the React Native files. This caused the nested `ViewVaultApp/ViewVaultApp/` issue.

## ✅ What's Fixed

- No more nested directories
- iOS project files are in the correct location: `ios/ViewVaultApp/`
- Network security is configured for your NAS
- All dependencies are properly set up

## 🏃‍♂️ Next Steps

1. **Update API endpoint** in `src/services/api.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const API_BASE = 'http://YOUR_NAS_IP:8008/api';
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open ios/ViewVaultApp.xcworkspace
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   npm run ios
   ```

## 🔧 If You Still Have Issues

### Pod install fails:
```bash
sudo gem update cocoapods
cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install && cd ..
```

### Build fails:
- Clean Xcode build: Product → Clean Build Folder
- Reset Metro cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`

### Network issues:
- Check your NAS IP in `src/services/api.ts`
- Make sure your NAS is running and accessible

## 📱 What You Get

- ✅ Native iOS interface for your watchlist
- ✅ View movies, series, and collections
- ✅ Toggle watched status
- ✅ Edit notes for items
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh functionality
- ✅ Dark theme matching your web app

**That's it! The iOS project files are now properly set up without nested directories.** 🎉
