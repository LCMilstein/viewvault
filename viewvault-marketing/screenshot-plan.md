## Best Practices for Copyright-Safe Screenshots

### Content Guidelines
1. **Use Generic Titles:** Create fictional movie/TV show names that sound realistic but don't reference actual content
2. **Placeholder Posters:** Design simple, generic movie poster layouts or use geometric patterns
3. **Avoid Real Actors:** Don't show actual celebrity photos or recognizable faces
4. **Generic Metadata:** Use example years, ratings, and descriptions that don't match real content

### Visual Guidelines
1. **Consistent Branding:** Ensure all screenshots maintain the CineSync color scheme (purple/teal gradient)
2. **High Quality:** Use high-resolution screenshots that look crisp on all devices
3. **Clean Data:** Show organized, realistic but fictional data
4. **Feature Focus:** Each screenshot should highlight specific features mentioned in the marketing copy

### Technical Specifications
- **Format:** PNG with transparency where appropriate
- **Resolution:** Minimum 1200px wide for desktop screenshots, 400px wide for mobile
- **File Size:** Optimize for web (under 500KB each)
- **Accessibility:** Ensure good contrast and readable text

### Example Safe Content
- Movie titles: "Adventure Quest", "Digital Dreams", "Ocean Mysteries", "Future Chronicles"
- TV shows: "City Life", "Tech Talks", "Adventure Academy", "Mystery Files"
- User names: "Demo User", "Sample Account", "Test Family"
- List names: "Weekend Picks", "Family Time", "Solo Adventures", "Documentary Corner"

## Implementation Notes

All screenshots are referenced in the HTML with fallback placeholder divs that display if images are missing. Ensure all images are properly optimized and include appropriate alt text for accessibility.

The site is designed to gracefully handle missing images, but having all screenshots will significantly improve the marketing effectiveness and user trust.
